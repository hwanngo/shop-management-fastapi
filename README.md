# Small Store Management Application

## Project Description

In response to the need for efficient inventory management and invoicing for a small family-owned store, I initiated a personal project to develop a customized solution. My goal was to create a user-friendly application tailored to the specific requirements of the business, while avoiding the use of costly commercial solutions available in the market.

### Project Details

- **Objective**: To create an in-house application for inventory management, product import/export tracking, and invoice generation for a small family-owned store.

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Programming Language: Python
  - Web Framework: FastAPI
  - Database: MariaDB
  - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

- **Project Status**: Work-in-progress (backend only).

## Key Accomplishments and Responsibilities

- **Requirement Analysis**: I conducted an in-depth analysis of the store's needs and business processes to determine the essential features and functionalities required in the application.

- **Application Development**: I began the development of the application using Python as the primary programming language, FastAPI as the web framework, and MariaDB as the database management system. The FastAPI framework enabled the development of a robust and fast backend for the application.

- **Authentication Integration**: I implemented JWT-based authentication to ensure the security and privacy of the store's data. This feature allows authorized personnel to access and manage the application's functionalities securely.

- **Database Design**: I designed the database schema to efficiently store and manage product information, inventory, and transaction data.

- **Work-in-Progress**: The project is currently a work-in-progress, focusing on the backend development. Future work may include the development of a user-friendly frontend interface and additional features to further streamline store management.

- **Future Plans**: As the project progresses, I intend to continue refining and expanding the application to meet the evolving needs of the small store. My goal is to provide a cost-effective, tailored solution that enhances operational efficiency and optimizes inventory management.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my skills in Python programming, web development using FastAPI, database design and management with MariaDB, and security implementation through JWT-based authentication. It reflects my commitment to delivering practical and cost-effective solutions for small businesses and my dedication to ongoing professional development.
